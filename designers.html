                        <h2>Arne Jacobsen</h2>
                        <p><strong>Denmark (1902–1971)</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            A master of total design, Jacobsen created not just furniture but entire visual systems
                            for buildings and brands. His Egg Chair and SAS House in Copenhagen remain icons of
                            Nordic design. His work exemplified the principle that every detail matters and contributes
                            to a unified whole.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Known for his organic, flowing furniture designs, Mathsson believed form should follow
                            nature, not geometry. His work emphasized comfort without ornamentation. He collaborated
                            with Arne Jacobsen and was instrumental in establishing Swedish modernism globally.

                        <p>
                            A prolific furniture designer, Wegner created over 500 designs during his lifetime,
                            each demonstrating masterful joinery and respect for materials. His Wishbone Chair and
                            Peacock Chair are icons. He believed in craftsmanship and that furniture should be made
                            to last generations.
