# Design Gallery Project: One-Week Guide

**Course:** IS 218 Enterprise AI Studio  
**Duration:** ~10 hours with AI  
**Method:** Vibe coding (AI writes code, you direct)

---

## 🎯 The Project

Transform Keith's Swiss-style site into a different design style using AI. You guide, AI codes, you review.

**Key difference:** AI can't see. You provide screenshots, make design decisions, iterate until excellent.

## 📋 5 Phases (10 Hours Total)

### Phase 1: Research (1 hour)
1. Pick a style from `/style-guides/` 
2. Find 10-15 authentic examples
3. Generate AI mockup with key characteristics

**Deliverable:** Research folder with images + design system doc

### Phase 2: Context (1 hour)
AI creates 3 content pages:
- Timeline of style's history
- Designer profiles
- Style guide explanation

**Deliverable:** 3 well-written content pages

### Phase 3: Planning (30 min)
Break work into 3 sprints:
1. Foundation (layout, colors, typography)
2. Components (nav, cards, buttons)
3. Polish (responsive, content, final QA)

**Deliverable:** Sprint plan with success criteria

### Phase 4: Build (6 hours)
Execute 3 sprints. Each sprint:
1. Describe changes to AI
2. AI generates code
3. Take screenshots
4. Review & iterate 2-3x
5. Move to next sprint

**Deliverable:** Complete transformed website

### Phase 5: Reflection (1.5 hours)
- AI writes collaboration story page
- Run Lighthouse (90+ all scores)
- Final QA check
- Deploy & document

**Deliverable:** Live site + collaboration story
