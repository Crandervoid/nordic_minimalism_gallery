                <h2>What Is Nordic Minimalism?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nordic Minimalism, also known as Scandinavian Design, is a humanized evolution of Swiss
                    modernism that emerged in the 1950s across Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland.
                    Unlike cold, austere minimalism, Nordic design embraces warmth, accessibility, and
                    connection to nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It represents a philosophy that less is more—but with soul. Every element serves a purpose,
                    materials are honest, and the overall aesthetic breathes calm and invites people in rather
                    than pushing them away.
                </p>

                <h2>The Philosophy: Lagom</h2>
                <p>
                    At the heart of Nordic design lies <em>lagom</em>, a Swedish word meaning
                    “not too much, not too little, just right.” This principle guides every design
                    decision—from spacing and color to typography and whitespace. It’s a balance between
                    restraint and warmth, minimalism and humanity.

                <h2>Color Palette</h2>
                <p>
                    Nordic Minimalism favors natural, muted tones inspired by Scandinavian landscapes:
                    sage greens, warm taupes, soft grays, and off-whites. These colors reflect long
                    winters, forests, and natural materials. Accents are restrained—when color appears,
                    it’s intentional and calming, never jarring.
                </p>

                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>
                    Nordic design uses humanist sans-serifs that feel approachable rather than clinical.
                    Generous line-height and letter-spacing create breathing room, making text feel spacious
                    and calm. Typography is about readability and rhythm, not decoration.
                </p>

                <h2>Connection to Nature</h2>
                <p>
                    Nordic design is rooted in the natural world. Materials are organic—wood, wool, leather,
                    natural fabrics. Forms echo nature: soft curves, natural edges, honest materials. The long
                    Scandinavian winters inspired a design philosophy that maximizes light, space, and
                    comfort. Designers sought to bring warmth and human connection into everyday objects and
                    environments.

                <h2>Evolution from Swiss Design</h2>
                <p>
                    While Swiss design (1950s–60s) emphasized geometric precision, grid systems, and
                    functional clarity, Nordic design took those principles and added warmth, humanity, and
                    cultural identity. Where Swiss design was international and austere, Nordic design was
                    regional and inviting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swiss modernism provided the foundation—the grid, the sans-serif, the restraint. But Nordic
                    designers softened these tools, adding subtle curves, natural materials, and a focus on how
                    objects and spaces made people <em>feel</em>, not just how they <em>functioned</em>.

                <h2>Today’s Nordic Influence</h2>
                <p>
                    Nordic design principles continue to shape contemporary digital and physical spaces.
                    Companies like Spotify, IKEA, and Muji embody Nordic values: simplicity, accessibility,
                    sustainability, and human-centered design. The philosophy has become a global aesthetic,
                    influencing everything from web design to interior spaces.
