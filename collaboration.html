            <p class="intro">
                A reflection on transforming a Swiss design starter into a warm, breathing Nordic Minimalism
                space—and what it taught us about thoughtful AI-human collaboration.
            </p>

            <section class="subsection section">
                <h2>The Initial Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    You chose Nordic Minimalism for a reason: it&apos;s the hardest style to get right in code.
                    Swiss Design is all geometry and grids—mechanical precision. Nordic Minimalism looks simple
                    but requires philosophy. It&apos;s about <em>feeling</em> first, aesthetics second. Warm where
                    Swiss is cool. Spacious where Swiss is efficient. Human where Swiss is rational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&apos;s what made it interesting. Not another sleek corporate site, but something that
                    actually reflects how Scandinavian people think: <em>lagom</em>—not too much, not too little,
                    just right.

            <section class="subsection section">
                <h2>Research and Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    We started where all good design work starts: reading. The Nordic Minimalism style guide
                    became our north star. Not a checklist of colors and fonts, but a philosophy—connection to
                    nature, democracy in design, sustainability, craft over trends, human wellbeing over maximalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that philosophy, we derived concrete decisions: off-white backgrounds (#FAFAF9) instead
                    of pure white to feel natural. Sage green (#8B9A8A) and warm taupe (#B4A89A) for accents—
                    colors you&apos;d find in Scandinavian forests and stone. 18px base text with 1.7 line-height—
                    slower, more generous reading. Humanist sans-serif stack prioritizing approachability over
                    technical perfection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every hex code, every rem value, every transition speed was traced back to Nordic philosophy.
                    That constraint made decisions easier.

                <h2>The Build: From Baseline to Living System</h2>
                <p><strong>Phase 1: Homepage Foundation</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The homepage started as semantic HTML (header, nav, main, footer) with basic styling.
                    But it felt corporate and sterile. Too much padding in the header. Gallery cards cramped.
                    Shadows too harsh. Spacing inconsistent. You could see the skeleton, not the warmth.
                </p>
                <img src="images/home-v1.png"
                     alt="Early version of homepage with inconsistent spacing and cold appearance">
                <p>
                    We refined it five times. Reduced header padding from 4rem to 3rem—less grand, more intimate.
                    Increased card padding to 2.5rem and gaps to 3rem. Softened shadows to barely-perceptible
                    (0px 4px 16px with 4% opacity). Changed section gaps to 7rem—that breathing room where you feel
                    <em>calm</em>, not bored.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Phase 2: Content Pages</strong></p>
                <p>
                    About, Timeline, Designers, Collaboration pages needed to feel cohesive with the homepage but
                    serve different purposes. About teaches philosophy. Timeline shows evolution. Designer profiles
                    build credibility. Each required different layout choices, but same underlying aesthetic.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Phase 3: Component System</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Six months into the project—just kidding, we did this in hours—but it felt right.
                    We extracted reusable components: <code>.section</code> for consistent 6rem gaps,
                    <code>.card</code> for all card-like content blocks,
                    <code>.card-grid</code> for layouts,
                    <code>.btn</code> and <code>.link</code> for interactions.
                    Suddenly every page felt like they were designed together, not assembled.

                <h2>The Hard Problem: Making Minimalism Warm</h2>
                <p>
                    Every iteration revealed a tension: minimalism can feel cold and austere if you&apos;re not
                    careful. We&apos;d hit moments where the design felt “right” structurally but <em>wrong</em>
                    emotionally.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution 1—Whitespace generosity.</strong> Instead of cramming content, we doubled
                    section gaps and doubled card padding. Counterintuitive for “minimal,” but Nordic Minimalism
                    isn&apos;t about <em>reduction</em>—it&apos;s about <em>restraint</em>. There&apos;s a
                    difference. Reduction = less stuff. Restraint = less than you want, but no more than you need.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution 2—Color warmth.</strong> Sage green instead of clinical gray. Warm taupe for
                    accents. Off-white backgrounds. Every color choice asked: “Would this exist in a Scandinavian
                    forest or home?” If yes, we used it.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution 3—Typography breathing room.</strong> 1.7 line-height, 0.3px letter-spacing.
                    Text feels like it&apos;s floating in comfortable space, not crammed into a box. You don&apos;t
                    consciously notice it, but you <em>feel</em> the difference.
                </p>

            <section class="subsection section">
                <h2>Mobile-First Reality</h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive design wasn&apos;t an afterthought. We built five breakpoints: 375px (mobile),
                    768px (tablet), 1024px (tablet large), 1440px (desktop), and 1920px (cinema). At each size,
                    we asked: Does this still feel Nordic? Does it still breathe?
                </p>
                <p>
                    On mobile, we reduced margins not to half, but thoughtfully—section gaps became 2.5rem
                    instead of 6rem. Cards still had 1.5rem padding. Navigation stacked vertically but links
                    stayed readable. No horizontal scrolling anywhere. The aesthetic compressed but didn&apos;t break.
                </p>

                <h2>Metrics &amp; Reflection</h2>
                <p><strong>By the numbers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 HTML pages (index, about, timeline, designers, collaboration)</li>
                    <li>1 comprehensive CSS file with base styles + 5 responsive breakpoints</li>
                    <li>8 reusable component classes</li>
                    <li>35+ refined color, spacing, and typography values</li>
                    <li>3 major design iterations before “feels right”</li>
                    <li>6+ designer profiles researched and written</li>
                    <li>12 content sections written from design philosophy principles</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Philosophy-first approach. Every decision traced back to
                    Nordic values, not trends. Component system from day one. Responsive design built in,
                    not bolted on. Real content, not placeholder text.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What was hard:</strong> Resisting the urge to add more. Every feature tempted:
                    animations, filters, gradients, interactive elements. But Nordic Minimalism is about saying no.
                    Each addition had to earn its place.

                <h2>Early vs. Final</h2>

                     alt="Screenshot of Lighthouse report with high scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO">
                <p>
                    Compare the early homepage to the final version. Same structure, but different
                    <em>feeling</em>. Early: sterile, corporate, cold. Final: warm, breathing, inviting.
                    The HTML structure changed maybe 5%. The CSS changed everything. That&apos;s where
                    Nordic Minimalism lives—in the details. The padding that makes space feel intentional.
                    The line-height that makes reading feel like conversation. The color that makes the
                    screen feel like a Scandinavian cabin, not an office.

            <section class="subsection section">
                <h2>What This Taught Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Good design collaboration isn&apos;t about one person having a vision and another implementing
                    it. It&apos;s about shared philosophy. You understood Nordic Minimalism deeply enough to push
                    back when something didn&apos;t feel right. I understood code well enough to translate that
                    feeling into specifics. Together, we iterated until the design felt <em>honest</em>—true to
                    philosophy, not just aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best part? Every decision is explainable. Why 6rem gaps? Because Nordic Minimalism values
                    generous space. Why sage green? Because it exists in nature. Why 1.7 line-height? Because it&apos;s
                    readable and calming. There&apos;s no arbitrary “I like this” anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>That&apos;s the kind of design work worth doing.</p>
