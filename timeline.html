                    <h2>1950s – The Birth of Nordic Design</h2>
                    <p><strong>Post-WWII Scandinavia</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Following World War II, designers across Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway began
                        combining Swiss modernist principles with local craft traditions and cultural values.
                        The result was a new design philosophy emphasizing democracy (design for everyone,
                        not elites), sustainability, and human warmth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Works:</strong> Arne Jacobsen&apos;s Egg Chair, Hans Wegner&apos;s furniture
                        designs, Alvar Aalto&apos;s organic modernism.

                    <h2>1960s–70s – The Golden Age</h2>
                    <p><strong>Refinement and International Recognition</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Nordic design gained global recognition as Scandinavian companies exported furniture,
                        textiles, and design philosophy worldwide. Designers refined their approach,
                        emphasizing natural materials, sustainable production, and timeless aesthetics
                        over trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Development:</strong> “Danish Modern” and “Swedish Modernism” become
                        recognized international movements.

                    <h2>1980s–90s – Digital Transition</h2>
                    <p><strong>From Objects to Interfaces</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        As technology emerged, Nordic designers applied their principles to digital spaces.
                        Simplicity, clarity, and human-centered design translated perfectly to early
                        interface design. The philosophy remained: less is more, form follows function,
                        and design should serve the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Shift:</strong> Nordic principles began influencing software, web design,
                        and digital products.

                    <h2>2000s – Global Digital Influence</h2>
                    <p><strong>Spotify, IKEA, and Beyond</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Swedish music streaming service Spotify launched with a clean, minimalist interface
                        rooted in Nordic principles. IKEA&apos;s website and digital presence embodied
                        accessibility and simplicity. These global companies made Nordic design a dominant
                        aesthetic in digital culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Companies:</strong> Spotify, IKEA, Muji (though Japanese, influenced by
                        Nordic values), and countless tech startups.

                    <h2>2010s–Present – Sustainability Focus</h2>
                    <p><strong>Timelessness and Environmental Responsibility</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Contemporary Nordic design emphasizes longevity over disposability. Designers create
                        objects and digital experiences meant to last—to resist trends. The movement has
                        evolved to address climate concerns and ethical production, staying true to its
                        post-war roots of democracy and responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Current Principles:</strong> Circular design, accessibility, digital ethics,
                        and human wellbeing.
